## Hey there! 👋

I'm [Maaya](https://linkedin.com/in/nifeesleman), a design engineer based in Germany.

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll build it and ship it.

My main tech stack is **React**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind**, and **Framer Motion**. My favorite tools are **Figma**, **Apple Notes**, and **Procreate** on my iPad.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite is the **Anime Scene Gallery**.

I've built over 100 public repos, but privately, it's probably more than 200 at this point.

If you want to learn how I do it, my books and course are available here!
