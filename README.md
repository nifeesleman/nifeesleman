**Hey there! 💪**

I'm **[Nife](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nifeesleman/)**, a blockchain & Web3 engineer

I design and build whatever I can imagine on-chain.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll turn it into a smart contract, test it thoroughly, and ship it.

My main tech stack includes **Solidity,Foundry,  React, Next.js, TypeScript, Node.js and JavaScript**. My favorite tools and Libraries are **VS Code,Remix, GitHub, OpenZeppelin,Solmate,PRBMath,Safe (Gnosis Safe) patterns,Git and Chainlink**. And my favorite Ethereum & Protocol Knowledge are **ERC standards(ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155 and ERC4337 (Account Abstraction), EntryPoint internals, Gas mechanics, Mempool vs private tx, Proxies (UUPS, Transparent) and CREATE2**

I’ve got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorite ones are related to  
**Account Abstraction (ERC-4337) and  DeFi logic**.

I’ve built **20+ public repositories**, and privately… it’s probably **40+** by now 😄

If you want to learn how I build secure, gas-optimized Web3 systems, follow my journey and projects here.

**Fun Facts:**

- I don’t drink coffee or tea ☕❌
