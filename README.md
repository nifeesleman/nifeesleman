## Hey there! 👋

I'm **<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nifeesleman/">Nife</a>**, a Web3 & blockchain developer based in Ethiopia 🇪🇹

I design and build whatever I can imagine.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I'll turn it into a smart contract, a DApp, or a real product — and ship it 🚀

My main tech stack includes **Solidity, Foundry, Ethereum Account Abstraction (ERC-4337), React, TypeScript, and Node.js**.  
My favorite tools are **VS Code, Foundry, GitHub, and on-chain testing frameworks**.

I've got a bunch of pinned projects, but my favorites are related to  
**Smart Contracts, Account Abstraction wallets, DeFi logic, and Web3 infrastructure**.

I've built **100+ public repositories**, and privately… it's probably **200+** by now.

I'm focused on building **real, production-level Web3 systems** and continuously leveling up as a blockchain engineer.
